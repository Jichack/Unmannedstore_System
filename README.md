The rapid rise of unmanned stores, driven by labor cost reduction and the expansion of contactless services, has brought a new challenge: a surge in sophisticated crimes such as theft, vandalism, and payment evasion.

To address these security loopholes, this capstone project develops an "Intelligent Video Analytics Security Solution" tailored for unmanned environments. By leveraging the provided dataset to train on customer behavior patterns, our system aims to go beyond simple motion detection. It focuses on identifying specific anomalies in real-time, such as concealing items or exiting without payment. Our goal is to provide store owners with immediate alerts and foster a secure, sustainable business environment through proactive crime prevention.
